$description = 'Home page of the Winston Churchill High School STEM Club. The STEM club at Winston Churchill High School seeks to foster intrigue and interest in STEM related fields, along with providing for students a catalyst and a community so they can make cool stuff. We seek to thoroughly explore and implement our understanding of STEM from beyond the classroom, beyond paper, and beyond solely theory. By engaging students-moreover, anyone who aspires to reach the bounds of STEM- we hope that we can equip our members with knowledge and experience extensively, whether up to professional grade or to that of a professed hobbyist.';
