            <h3>Beverly Farms STEAM Night (February 22, 2018)</h3>
            <p>
                BFES STEAM Night was held at the local elemen&shy;tary school,
                <a href="http://montgomeryschoolsmd.org/schools/beverlyfarmses/">Beverly Farms</a>. We presented our robot and two
                computer programs to engage the elementary students in STEAM. There were about a dozen other presenters, including
                two other FTC teams, several science experiments, and a local fire station demonstrating pulleys.

                We let the students drive our robot around a smaller field. They enjoyed driving it with the game controllers we
                use, and we learned about how best to explain to new team members how to drive the robot because we learned how to
                explain it to elementary school kids.

                One of the programs was a Java app that did mirrored drawing. The other was a Javascript programming game. It is
                possible to complete the game (getting a red square, controlled with the arrow keys, to a green zone) without
                changing anything, but it is much easier, and more fun, to change variables about the world and square such as
                gravity and jump power. <a href="bfes-steam/game">Try it here.</a> The students loved playing the games and a few
                parents were transfixed on the drawing app.
