    <h3>Command Line Interfaces and More (12/14/18)</h3>
    <p>The command line-or, a shell-can help a user better understand their machine.
    Frequently, a shell is also more pliable to the demands of the user than the graphical interface may allow.
    We'll cover simple file managment commands, User account control/permissions, some networking 
    utilities (ssh, telnet), and more. </p>
    
    <p>By the end of the lesson you should be able to navigate and modify-possibly corrupt-
    files in your filesystem, change read, write, and editing permissions of your files, and SSH into a raspberry pi.</p>
    <p>It is imperitive to bring in your own machine (laptop-OSX/Windows/Linux-any OS is fine, pi, 
    maybe a phone with a shell, who cares, as long as it has a shell). It would be nice to boot something else on a school 
    chromebook but I don't think we're allowed to do that and we haven't asked. You should make sure you have administrator
    permissions on your computer.</p>
    <p>Totally lost? It's okay. Read <a href="http://www.linfo.org/shell.html">this</a>. Done? Still lost? Come in anyway.</p>
